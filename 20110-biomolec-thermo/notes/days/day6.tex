Recall from last time that enthalpy $H$ is $H = U + PV$, so $\Delta H = \Delta U + \Delta PV$. 
In particular, at constant pressure, \[
	\Delta H = \Delta U + P\Delta V = \Delta U - w = q.
\]
Now, we can represent reactions as $U$ vs ``reaction" where $U$ is any state function, and then we can compare reactants to products:

	The $x$-axis in the above plot is the \vocab{reaction coordinate}, which measures how far a reaction has proceeded.
